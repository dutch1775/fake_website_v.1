            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (bass and keyboards) and John Bonham (drums).
                With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, Led Zeppelin drew from influences including blues and folk music, and are cited as a progenitor of hard rock and heavy metal. 
                They significantly influenced the music industry, particularly the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock. </p>

            <p>Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated record sales of between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. 
                They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the 
                Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 
                Rolling Stone described them as "the heaviest band of all time", "the biggest band of the seventies", and "unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history". 
                They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography states that they were "as influential" in the 1970s as the Beatles were in the 1960s.</p>
